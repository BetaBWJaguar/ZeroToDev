This slide focuses on two powerful aspects of Java’s design:
High Performance and Distributed Computing Support.

Let’s start with performance.

Even though Java runs on a virtual machine, it is not slow by design. In fact, Java achieves high performance through a technology called Just-In-Time compilation, or JIT.

The JVM monitors which parts of the bytecode are used frequently. When it detects “hot” code — code that runs often — it compiles that bytecode into highly optimized native machine code while the program is running.

This allows Java applications to get faster over time. Some of the common JIT optimizations mentioned here include:

Method inlining
Dead code elimination
Constant folding
Optimized method calls

The result is that long-running Java applications can reach near-native performance.

Now let’s look at the distributed side.

Java was designed with networking and distributed systems in mind, especially because it became popular during the growth of the Internet.

Java provides built-in support for:

Networking
Communication between machines
Remote method calls
Distributed system development

This means Java applications can easily communicate over networks and run across multiple computers, which is essential for modern web systems, cloud services, and enterprise platforms.

So this slide highlights a key balance in Java’s design:

Java provides portability and safety —
but also delivers strong runtime performance and powerful networking capabilities.
