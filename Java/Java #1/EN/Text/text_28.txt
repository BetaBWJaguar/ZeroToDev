In this slide, we are talking about abstraction level — specifically, what Java and C++ hide from us, and what they expose to the developer.

Let’s start with a simple question: What is abstraction?

Abstraction is the idea of hiding complexity.
As developers, we focus on what we want the program to do, not necessarily how every low-level operation is performed behind the scenes.

However, not every programming language provides the same level of abstraction.
And this is where Java and C++ take very different approaches.

The critical difference is this:
Java hides much more of the system, while C++ exposes much more of it.

Now let’s look at how that actually works in practice.

In Java, the path from the developer to the hardware looks like this:
Developer → Java → JVM → Operating System → Hardware

When we write Java code, we don’t interact directly with the operating system or the hardware.
Instead, our code runs inside the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM.
The JVM handles memory management, system interaction, and many low-level details for us.
This gives us safety, portability, and convenience — but less direct control.

In C++, the path is shorter and more direct:
Developer → C++ → Operating System → Hardware

Here, there is no virtual machine in between.
The program communicates much closer to the system level.
This gives developers more power and more control — but also more responsibility.

Let’s look at a simple example with arrays.

In Java, we write:
int[] numbers = new int[5];

Memory is automatically managed. We don’t decide where it lives, and we don’t manually free it. The JVM and the garbage collector take care of that.

In C++, we write:
int* numbers = new int[5];

Here, we are directly allocating memory on the heap.
And importantly, we are responsible for freeing that memory later.
If we forget, we can create memory leaks. If we misuse it, we can cause crashes.

So the key idea of this slide is:

Java prioritizes safety and simplicity by hiding system complexity.
C++ prioritizes control and performance by exposing system details.

Same computer. Same hardware.
But two very different perspectives for the developer.

And that difference in abstraction level affects everything — from performance and security to how easy a language is to learn and use.
