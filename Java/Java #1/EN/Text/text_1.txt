Hello and welcome to the Java Fundamentals course.

In this training series, we will explore together the Java programming language — a language that has stood strong for decades, forms the backbone of millions of systems, and is still actively used today.

Java is not just a programming language.
Java is also a philosophy, an architectural approach, and a powerful perspective on how large-scale software systems should be built.

The main goal of this presentation is not to teach Java merely as a language used to write code, but to help you understand why it was created, which problems it was designed to solve, and why it became so widely adopted.

Throughout this course, we will gradually cover:
– The fundamental concepts of Java,
– The role of object-oriented programming in Java,
– The process of writing and running Java programs,
– And most importantly, the mindset behind software development.

At this point, one thing should be emphasized clearly:
Learning Java is not just about learning Java.
Learning Java means learning disciplined coding, readability, long-term thinking, and sustainable software development.

The structure of this presentation is very clear.
First, we will answer the question: What is Java?
Then, we will clarify what you will learn throughout this course.
Finally, we will explore how Java emerged by looking at its historical background and understanding why it became so powerful.

This course serves as:
– A solid starting point for beginners,
– And a clarifying guide for those who already have some background.

If your goal is not just to memorize code, but to truly understand the logic of software development, this series is designed exactly for you.

Now, without further delay…
Let’s take our first step into the world of Java together.
