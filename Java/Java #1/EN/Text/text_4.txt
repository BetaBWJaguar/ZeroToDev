“In this slide, we take a closer look at the history of Java—why and how this language came into existence.

Java’s story actually begins with a technological need.
When we go back to the early 1990s, the computer world was not standardized like it is today.
Every device was different, every system was different, and software was not portable.

If you were a software developer at that time, you were facing a serious problem.
You wrote a program, but it only worked on a single machine.
When you moved to another computer, you had to rewrite everything from scratch.

James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems recognized this exact problem.
The issue was clear:
Hardware was constantly changing, but software couldn’t keep up with that change.

In 1991, a project called Oak was launched to solve this problem.
Oak’s original target was not the internet.
Its main focus was the smart devices that were emerging at the time:
televisions, set-top boxes, and embedded systems.

These devices shared a common problem.
Their hardware was very different from one another, yet they required the same software logic.
This is where the core idea behind Oak was born:
Code should not be dependent on hardware.

Over time, however, a reality became clear.
The smart TV market did not grow as expected.
The Oak project faced the risk of commercial failure.
In fact, the project was almost canceled.

At that very moment, something much bigger was happening in the world.
The internet was spreading rapidly.
Web browsers were becoming popular.
And there was a growing need for secure, portable software that everyone could access.

Gosling and his team had a critical realization:
The problem wasn’t devices—it was platforms.
And the solution was a single piece of software that could run on every platform.

Oak was a perfect fit for this new need.
It was platform-independent.
It was security-focused.
It was not directly tied to hardware.

In 1995, Oak was reborn.
Its name was changed, and it was introduced to the world as Java.
Java stepped onto the stage as a language designed for the internet era.

And it brought with it a powerful philosophy:
Write once, run anywhere.

This philosophy was not just a slogan.
It was an approach that fundamentally changed the way software was developed.
And this perspective is the main reason why Java remains powerful even today.”
