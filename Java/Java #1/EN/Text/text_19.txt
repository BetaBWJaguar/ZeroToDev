Now we arrive at one of the most important ideas behind Java — Object-Oriented Programming, often called OOP.

Java is not just a language where we write instructions one after another.
Instead, Java is built around objects — just like the real world.

Think about the world around you.
You see cars, students, bank accounts, phones.
Each of these is an object.
They have properties and behaviors.

Java follows the same idea.

In Java, we first define a class.
A class is like a blueprint.

For example, imagine we define a class called Car.
This class can describe things like the model, color, year, and price.

But a class alone is just a plan.

When we actually create a specific car —
for example, a red 2022 Toyota —
that becomes an object, an instance of the Car class.

So the relationship is simple:

Real-world idea → Class → Object → Program logic

This structure helps us organize programs in a way that is easier to understand and manage.
Instead of dealing with thousands of loose variables and functions,
we group related data and behavior into meaningful units — objects.

That is why OOP makes Java programs:

More organized
Easier to expand
Easier to maintain

When you understand objects, you stop just writing code…
and start designing systems.
