At this point, we can move on to the fundamental question:
What is Java?

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent.
However, this definition alone is not sufficient.
To truly understand Java, we need to unpack what this definition really means.

First of all, Java is a high-level programming language.
This means that when developing software with Java, we focus on the problem itself and the solution logic — not on hardware details.
Memory addresses, processor architecture, and low-level hardware instructions are abstracted away from the developer.
This makes Java both safer and more readable.

One of Java’s most important characteristics is that it is built around object-oriented programming.
In Java, programs are designed using classes, objects, and the relationships between them.
This approach allows real-world entities to be represented directly in software.

Another critical aspect of Java is its platform independence.
A Java program does not run directly on the operating system, but on the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM.
Thanks to this architecture, the same Java code can run on Windows, Linux, or macOS without any modification.

This concept gave rise to Java’s famous slogan:
“Write once, run anywhere.”

Java also provides a secure and robust structure by design.
There is no direct memory access, memory management is handled automatically, and code is verified before execution.
This makes Java an ideal choice, especially for large-scale and long-lived projects.

Because of these features, Java is widely used in:
– Enterprise applications,
– Web-based systems,
– Server-side software.

In short, Java is a powerful programming language that represents modern software development principles by prioritizing security, portability, and sustainability.
