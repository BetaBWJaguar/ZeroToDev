“To understand why Java is so important, we first need to look at what the software world was like before Java.

In the early 1990s, software development was not as comfortable as it is today.
There was no common standard.
Every computer, every operating system, and almost every processor lived in its own separate world.

When a software developer wrote a program, that program usually ran on only a single machine.
Moving the same software to another computer was often not possible.
This meant one thing:
The same idea, the same application, but code rewritten over and over again.

This situation caused major chaos in the software world.
There was a loss of time.
Costs were high.
Maintenance became difficult.
And most importantly, software was not sustainable.

The most widely used languages of that era, C and C++, were extremely powerful in terms of performance.
However, that power also came with serious problems.
These languages were tightly coupled to hardware.
Separate compilation was required for each operating system.

Memory management was entirely the developer’s responsibility.
A single mistake in memory handling could cause a program to crash or lead to security vulnerabilities.
Problems like buffer overflows were very common.

In short, we can say this:
One system meant one piece of software.
A program written for Windows would not run on Linux.
Different processors required different compilers.

At this point, a very fundamental question emerged:
“Why does software have to be so dependent on hardware?”

Before Java, there was no clear answer to this question.
But this question became the biggest driving force behind the birth of Java.

Java told the software world something revolutionary:
Code should be platform-independent.
Software should focus on logic, not hardware.

And thus, a brand-new era in software development began.”
