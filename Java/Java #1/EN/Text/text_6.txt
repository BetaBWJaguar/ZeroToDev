The story of Java did not actually begin with the name Java.
When we go back to the year 1991, there was a small but highly visionary team within Sun Microsystems. At the head of this team was James Gosling.

At that time, the team believed that the future was not computers, but “smart devices.”
Televisions, set-top boxes, home electronics devices…
But there was a very big problem.

Each of these devices had different hardware.
Software had to be developed separately for each one.
This was both a waste of time and not sustainable.

This is where the Oak Project emerged.
The core goal of Oak was very clear:
To create a programming language that was hardware-independent, secure, lightweight, and capable of running everywhere.

Oak needed to have a simple syntax.
It had to remove memory management from the developer’s responsibility.
And most importantly:
The same code had to run on different devices.

This idea was quite radical for its time.
Because the software world was full of hardware-dependent languages.

The Oak Project was not the birth of a language, but the birth of a philosophy:
“The same code should run everywhere.”

This way of thinking was the very first step of a revolution that would later fundamentally change the software world.
