In this slide, we enter the modern era of Java — the period where Java moved beyond traditional enterprise systems and became a key player in cloud computing and microservices architecture.

Technology evolved rapidly. Applications were no longer running on a single server. Instead, systems became distributed, scalable, and cloud-native. Java adapted to this transformation — and did it incredibly well.

One of the biggest game changers in this era is Spring Boot.
Spring Boot allows developers to build production-ready applications quickly, with minimal configuration. Instead of spending hours setting up infrastructure, developers can now focus directly on business logic.

You can see a simple example on the slide: a REST API endpoint using @GetMapping.
This represents a shift in how Java applications are built — from monolithic systems to lightweight, independent services.

This era also introduced:

REST APIs – Java applications now commonly communicate over HTTP using JSON.

Microservices architecture – Large systems are broken into small, independent services that can scale separately.

Docker & Kubernetes – Java applications are packaged into containers and deployed in cloud environments efficiently.

Java also became more functional and expressive starting from Java 8 and beyond, bringing features like lambdas and streams that work beautifully in data-processing and cloud-native services.

So what does this mean overall?

Java is no longer just “enterprise backend language.”
It is now a cloud-native powerhouse capable of running:

High-scale web applications

Distributed systems

Containerized microservices

This era proves something important:
Java did not stay in the past. It evolved with the cloud.
