The Oak Project was technically successful.
However, commercially, things did not go as expected.

By 1994, the smart TV market did not receive the anticipated interest.
The devices planned for Oak did not become widespread.
And the project was almost shelved.

At exactly this point, something very important was happening in the world:
The Internet was growing.

Web browsers were rapidly becoming popular.
For the first time, people began accessing the same content from different computers.
But the code written for the web was still platform-dependent.

This is where the realization that changed Oak’s destiny emerged:
“The future is not televisions… it is the web.”

The features Oak already had were perfect for the Internet:
It was platform-independent.
It was secure.
It was lightweight and efficient.
It was not directly tied to hardware.

As a result, Oak changed direction.
From devices to browsers,
from a closed project to an open technology.

Along with this transformation, Oak’s name also changed.
Its new name: Java.

And in 1995, Java was officially introduced to the world.

Java was no longer just a language.
It was a universal platform designed for the Internet era.

From that moment on, Java’s journey began.
And this journey permanently established the philosophy of
“Write Once, Run Anywhere” in the software world.
