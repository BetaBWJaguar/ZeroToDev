Before we start writing and running Java programs, we must first prepare our system environment properly.
Because if Java is not installed and configured correctly, the computer will not be able to recognize Java commands, compile source code, or execute Java applications in a stable and reliable way.

The first thing we need is the JDK, which stands for Java Development Kit.
The JDK is the main and essential package required for Java development.
It provides all the fundamental tools that developers need to write, compile, and run Java programs efficiently.

Inside the JDK, there are two very important components.
The first one is the Java compiler, called javac, which converts human-readable source code into bytecode.
The second one is the Java runtime, called java, which executes the compiled bytecode.

The compiler is responsible for transforming our Java source files into platform-independent bytecode.
This bytecode is then executed by the JVM, which stands for Java Virtual Machine.
The JVM acts as an execution layer that allows Java programs to run on different operating systems without modification.

Now, the setup process begins with downloading the JDK from a trusted and official source such as Oracle or OpenJDK.
Choosing a reliable source ensures stability, security, and compatibility with modern development tools.
After downloading the installer, we install it on our computer just like any standard software application.

Once the installation is complete, the next critical step is configuring system variables.
This configuration is extremely important because it allows the operating system to detect and use Java tools directly from the command line interface.

The most important system variable is JAVA_HOME.
JAVA_HOME points to the main directory where the JDK is installed on the system.
This variable is widely used by IDEs, build tools, and development frameworks to locate the Java environment automatically.

After setting JAVA_HOME, we must add the JDK bin folder to the system PATH variable.
The bin directory contains essential executable tools such as java, javac, and other development utilities.
By adding this directory to PATH, we enable the system to access Java commands globally from any terminal location.

This configuration makes Java portable, flexible, and convenient for development across different projects.
Without properly setting the PATH variable, the system would fail to recognize Java commands outside the installation directory.

Finally, we verify the installation using the command prompt or terminal.
We type java dash version to check whether the Java runtime environment is correctly installed and accessible.
Then we type javac dash version to confirm that the Java compiler is also properly configured.

If both commands display valid version information without errors, it means the Java environment setup has been completed successfully.
At this point, the system is fully prepared to compile, execute, and develop Java applications smoothly and efficiently.
